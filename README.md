# FACT (Fight against corona threat)

Corona spreads only when personal hygiene is low. Let us **fight against corona threat** by conscious personal hygiene.

We all make a few unconscious hand movements and it is equally simple to be conscious about these movements. Now, let us **fight against corona threat** together.

Pledge to follow these simple ways to prevent corona virus

1. Sneeze into your elbow so that hands are not contaminated
2. Do not touch contaminated surfaces
3. Wash your hands
4. Gargle with salt water
5. Ensure hygiene before touching the yours or your loved one&#39;s face
6. Communicate personal hygiene threats around you by gently raising your hand and showing a zero. A gentle way of reminding others about washing hands.
